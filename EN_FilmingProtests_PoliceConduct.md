### 1. Be Prepared
Laws on filming authorities vary by country. Know your rights before you
turn on the camera. Develop a security plan to protect your safety.
Memorize emergency contact information, or keep it written in a secure
location. Use a camera strap or tie your camera to your wrist. Know your
equipment. If you can’t run with it, don’t bring it.

### 2. Power Up
Bring additional charged batteries and empty memory cards. If filming
with a smartphone, maximize battery life by turning off apps and the
wifi locator, and lower the brightness on your device’s screen.

### 3. Record Yourself
Speak into the camera to verify that you are the one filming.
Alternately, keep a written record with the original video file. If you
need to be anonymous for security reasons, use a code name.

### 4. Verification
Your media is easier to verify if you capture the date, time and
location of your footage. If possible, turn on automatic date, time and
GPS location capturing features. Alternately, film newspapers,
intersections, street signs and landmarks.

### 5. Film with Intention
Hold shots for a minimum of 10 seconds. Keep the camera steady and move
it very slowly when changing your position. Avoid jerky movements and
zooming.

### 6. Various Angles
Contextualize events through wide and medium shots. Use close-ups to
capture details. Use various angles and elevation to capture the size
and behavior of the crowd. Capture footage of the presence and formation
of authorities. If identities should be anonymous, film crowds from
behind and only record the backs of people’s heads or their feet.

### 7. Capture Detail
When safe, document the details of an arrest or violence by filming the
identities of individuals involved, the surrounding crowd, injuries,
bullet holes or nearby vehicles. Contextualize details by narrating the
incident as you film.

### 8. Filming Authorities
When possible, film or record yourself saying officers’ names and their
badge/helmet numbers. Record general police conduct such as orders being
given to officers, or when barricades are created or moved. Document
police that are filming the protests and any weapons that the
authorities are holding or using.

### 9. Conduct Interviews
Provide additional details through interviews with consenting protestors
or eye-witnesses. Ensure those you film are fully aware of how and where
the video will be used. Discuss potential safety risks if the video is
to be shared publicly, online or with authorities. If anonymity is
needed, film interviewees’ hands while they speak, have the subject wrap
their face in a scarf, or adjust the focus to blur the image.

### 10. Work as a Team
Have a partner help keep you safe and watch for important situations to
document. If your partner has a camera, try to get separate angles of
the same incident. Try to keep each other in view. If you are at risk of
arrest and want to keep filming, consider giving media cards to a friend
who can guard it and replace with an empty card.
